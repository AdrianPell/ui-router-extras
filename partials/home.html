    <h3>UI-Router Extras</h3>
    <aside class="well">
        <a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/">UI-Router</a> is the defacto router for AngularJS.  
        The UI-Router-Extras project enhances UI-Router with three additional features.
    </aside>
    
    <h4>Sticky States <small>(aka Parallel States)</small></h4>
    <section class="well-sm">
        <p>
            Sticky States allows a tree of states to be long-lived, running concurrently alongside one or more other state
            trees.  This is also sometimes referred to as Parallel States.
            The basis for this functionality is to implement a "tabs" use case.  Using UI-Router Extras Sticky States,
            a single page angular app can implement independent tab state trees, which operate in parallel to each other.
        </p>
    </section>

    <h4>Deep State Redirect</h4>
    <section class="well-sm">
        <p> Deep State Redirect is a marker you can add to a state definition.</p>
        <p> UI-Router Extras will keep track of
            the last activated substate and parameters of your marked state.  A user may navigate anywhere else
            in the state tree.  When the DSR marked state is navigated to directly, UI-Router Extras will redirect to
            the previously activated state and parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
            The basis for this use case for this feature is navigation based.  In the "tabs" use case, you could mark
            the tab as <code>deepStateRedirect</code>.  When the user navigates into the tab, and drills down to a substate,
            DSR will remember the substate.  The user can then navigate to other tabs (or somewhere else completely).  When
            they click the original tab again, it will transition to the previous state and parameters of that tab, making it
            appear that the tab was never destructed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Deep State Redirect can be used with StickyStates, or on its own.  If used with a Sticky State, the states
            will be reactivated, and the DOM will be unchanged (as opposed to the states being re-entered and controllers
            re-initialized)
        </p>
    </section>

    <h4>Future States</h4>
    <section class="well-sm">
        <p>
            Future States allow the UI-Router state tree to be late-bound.  The application's state tree can be loaded 
            at Runtime.  Also, states can be lazy loaded (late binding), waiting until there is a request to transition 
            to the state.
