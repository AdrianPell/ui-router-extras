<div class="lead">Click the &quot;Personnel Management&quot; tab.</div>
<ul>
    <li> Drill down through the Personnel states until you are editing an employee record. </li>
    <li> Modify some data on the employee record.  There is intentionally no save button.</li>
    <li> Click the &quot;Inventory Management&quot; tab and drill down the tab&apos;s states until you are viewing a Product. </li>
    <li> Click the &quot;Personnel Management tab&quot;. Deep State Redirect sends you back to the employee record 
        state, while Sticky State preserves the DOM and $scope exactly as you left it (including scroll position, etc). </li>
    <li> Click the &quot;Inventory Management&quot; tab. Deep State Redirect sends you back to the product record, 
        and Sticky State preserves the DOM and $scope. </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Each sticky state has its own named ui-view.
    This demo hides the preserved DOM for inactivated states using the ng-show directive.  
    The DOM for inactivated states can be viewed using your browsers dev tools.
